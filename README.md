# Cow-Identification

### The problem:
Given a picture of a cow, decide which cow from among a set of cows the picture represents, if any.

### How it works:
A neural network is trained (using Keras) to construct a model that classifies cows (accuracy: >90%).

## Installation:
Clone this repository to your local machine and run:
```
cd Cow-Identification
pip install Keras
pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu --user
python main.py
```
